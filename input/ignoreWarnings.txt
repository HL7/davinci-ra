INFORMATION: Bundle/h1: Bundle: Validate resource against profile http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Bundle

# The slice is open with the intention of allowing entries for non-defined resources.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-ra/StructureDefinition/ra-measurereport-bundle

# MEASURE_MR_M_SCORING_UNK: This is intended.  The measureScore attribute is not required.
The scoring system in this measure is unknown, so the measureScore values cannot be checked

# MEASURE_M_NO_GROUPS: This is intended.  Currently, the support for Risk Adjustment does not include a practical way to model the groups as the number are prohibitive.  A solution is being worked on, but the Measure resource does not require a group so this should not be a blocking issue.
WARNING: Measure/RAModelExample01: Measure: A measure should contain at least one group
WARNING: Measure/RAModelExample02: Measure: A measure should contain at least one group
