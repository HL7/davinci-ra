# MEASURE_MR_M_SCORING_UNK: This is intended.  The measureScore attribute is not required.
The scoring system in this measure is unknown, so the measureScore values cannot be checked

# MEASURE_M_NO_GROUPS: This is intended.  Currently, the support for Risk Adjustment does not include a practical way to model the groups as the number are prohibitive.  A solution is being worked on, but the Measure resource does not require a group so this should not be a blocking issue.
A measure should contain at least one group

# BUNDLE_SEARCH_SELF_NOT_UNDERSTOOD: this is intended.  The search string intentionally does not include a type.
No types could be determined from the search string, so the types can''t be checked

# input\examples\Bundle-ra-bundle01.json: these are intended.  The slicing includes definitions for Patient and MeasureReport but allows for others who's types are not known at build time.
