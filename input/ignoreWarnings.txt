# MEASURE_MR_GRP_UNK_CODE (37): pending update to the publisher to not require matching groups in the MeasureReport of no groups are defined in the MeasureReport.  Ref Zulip: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179165-committers/topic/MeasureReport.2Egroup.20validation.  PR has been merged: https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core/pull/630, just waiting for it to be included in a release.
