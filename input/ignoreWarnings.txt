# MEASURE_MR_M_SCORING_UNK: This is intended.  The measureScore attribute is not required.
The scoring system in this measure is unknown, so the measureScore values cannot be checked

# MEASURE_M_NO_GROUPS: This is intended.  Currently, the support for Risk Adjustment does not include a practical way to model the groups as the number are prohibitive.  A solution is being worked on, but the Measure resource does not require a group so this should not be a blocking issue.
A measure should contain at least one group

# input\examples\Bundle-ra-bundle01.json: these are intended.  The slicing includes definitions for Patient and MeasureReport but allows for others who's types are not known at build time.
This element does not match any known slice defined in the profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-ra/StructureDefinition/ra-measurereport-bundle|2.0.0 (this may not be a problem, but you should check that it's not intended to match a slice)
