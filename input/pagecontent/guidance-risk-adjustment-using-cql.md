*This section describes specifying a Condition Category (e.g., HCC189) as a digital Condition Category measure using Clinical Quality Language (CQL) and provides guidance and a framework that will allow payers/vendors to automate the process of identifying members/patients with coding gaps for a clinical evaluation period.*  

###  Condition Category Measure



| Population | Definition |
|:----|:----|
| Initial Population | The initial population refers to all patients to be evaluated by a Condition Category Measure involving patients who share a common set of specified characteristics. All patients counted (for example, as closed gap population) are drawn from the initial population. |
| Closed Gap Population | The closed gap population are patients with confirmed coding gap and have an eligible encounter diagnosis during the current clinical evaluation period. |
| Closed Gap Exclusion | The closed gap exclusion criteria define patients to be removed from the closed gap population. |
| Historic Population | The historic population are patients with an eligible encounter diagnosis outside of the current clinical evaluation period and have coding gaps that are open. |
| Historic Population Exclusion | The historic exclusion criteria define patients to be removed from the historic population. |
| Suspected Population | The suspected population criteria is defined by using payers/vendors' internal suspecting algorithms. The coding gaps are open. |
| Suspected Population Exclusion | The suspected exclusion criteria define patients to be removed from the suspected exclusion. This is defined by using payers/vendors' internal suspecting algorithms. |
