### Introduction

The Da Vinci Project member organizations have identified the need of standardizing how risk adjustment coding gaps are communicated between payers and providers. This release of the Implementation Guide (guide) specifies standardized risk adjustment coding gap reports and defines an operation for a Client to query the coding gap reports from a Server for one or more patients. Standardizing the reporting structure helps lessen the burden on the providers in processing the reports so they can more easily address the patients’ care needs. This standardized structure also supports the payer sharing information that they have but the providers may not, such as data from other providers’s claims, lab results, filled prescriptions, etc.

### Preconditions and Assumptions

- A contract for medical services exists between the Server and the Client requesting the risk adjustment coding gap reports.
- Risk adjustment coding gap reports are pre-generated on the Server by a backend system such as a risk adjustment engine for risk adjustment model(s).
- It is the responsibility of the Server to ensure that the data used in the report is present in a structured and retrievable form.
- The Server and the Client have agreed upon a process to identify specific patient(s) and exchange the Patient resource's logical id on the Server.
- Although the exact mechanisms for securing these exchanges are not specified as part of this guide:
    -  Exchanges are limited to mutually agreed upon (i.e., between the Server and Client) patient lists or population.
    -  Systems should use standard authentication and authorization approaches. The [SMART App Launch] and [SMART backend services] authentication/authorization approach are recommended models.

### $Report Operation and Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report

The risk adjustment coding gap reports are generated by a Server’s back end systems such as legacy system, FHIR server, and risk adjustment engine. The [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report], a profile of the [MeasureReport] resource, provides a standardized representation to construct these reports. The [$report] operation defined in this guide can be used by a Client to request risk adjustment coding gap reports of applicable risk adjustment models for one or more patients (a Group) from the Server.

#### $Report Operation
The [$report] operation requires three input (IN) parameters: `subject`, `periodStart`, and `periodEnd`. The `subject` parameter references either a single patient or a group of patients (as specified in the [Patient Group] profile). The term clinical evaluation period refers to the time period during which the risk adjusting encounters could be conducted and documented with expectations of submissions for risk adjustment purposes. The `periodStart` and `periodEnd` parameters are the start and end dates of the clinical evaluation period.

If the `subject` is valid, the dates provided in `periodStart` and `periodEnd` will then be evaluated for any overlaps against the clinical evaluation period (`MeasureReport.period.start` and `MeasureReport.period.end`) of risk adjustment coding gap reports available on the Server for that patient. The [$report] operation returns a [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle] if matching risk adjustment coding gap reports were found for a patient. This bundle is a FHIR collection bundle, which must contain a patient ([USCore Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html)) entry and zero or more entries of risk adjustment coding gap reports ([Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report]). All risk adjustment coding gap reports contained in a [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle] must be for the same patient. The [$report] operation also defines another output (OUT) parameter, `OperationOutcome`, to address scenarios when the `subject` provided is invalid. Detailed documentation and conformance statements are listed on the page for [$report].

An example workflow of a Client calls the $report operation to request risk adjustment coding gap reports for a single patient is shown below in Figure 3-1.

#### Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report
The [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] is used to represent coding gap report for a single patient and a version specific risk adjustment model. The required `MeasureReport.subject` references [USCore Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html) and the required `MeasureReport.measure` element references the [Risk Adjustment Model Measure]. The [Risk Adjustment Model Measure] profile specifies risk adjustment model information, which requires both a model identifier and a version. If the Server's risk adjustment engine runs multiple risk adjustment models including different versions of the same model, then there will be multiple risk adjustment coding gap reports for a patient. For example, if a risk adjustment engine runs reports using CMS-HCC V25, CMS-HCC V24, and Rx-HCC V5, then there will be three separate risk adjustment coding gap reports for the patient, each for a version specific risk adjustment model.

The [MeasureReport] resource has zero to many `group` elements. Each `group` element contains information for a Condition Category, therefore, multiple Condition Category codes. The `group.code` is used to represent the actual code for a Condition Category, such as HCC 18 (Diabetes with No Complication). The [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] profile added several extensions to the MeasureReport resource’s `group` element to provide additional information about a Condition Category, which includes:
 - the suspect type for a Condition Category coding gap that is either historic, suspected, or unsuspected;
 - the evidence status of a Condition Category coding gap that is either confirmed, non-confirmed, or pending;
 - the evidence status date indicating when the evidence status was last updated; and
 - the hierarchical status indicating whether hierarchies were applied to a Condition Category, and if applied, whether the Condition Category is superseded. The status can be either applied-superseded, applied-not-superseded, not-applied, or not-applicable.

In addition, the [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] provides capability of sharing supporting evidence for a Condition Category through the use of the `MeasureReport.evaluatedResource` element. This supporting evidence may include resources for data such as encounters, lab results, medications, and procedures, and the `evaluatedResource` shall reference the appropriate US Core profile. The extension [ra-groupReference](StructureDefinition-ra-groupReference.html) added to the `evaluatedResource` element enables tying a specific supporting evidence to a Condition Category. This is accomplished by setting the extension’s `valueString` to be the same value of the `MeasureGroup.group.id` of the Condition Category to establish the association between a supporting evidence and one or more Condition Categories.  

### Example Risk Adjustment Coding Gaps Report

Figure 3-2 is an example risk adjustment coding gap report. The Client calls the [$report] operation for patient Eve Everywoman (`subject`) and for a clinical evaluation period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (`periodStart` and `periodEnd`). The Server receives the request and finds a matching risk adjustment coding gap report for Eve Everywoman that has a clinical evaluation period of January 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021, which overlaps the `periodStart` and `periodEnd` dates provided in the [$report] operation. This report was created by a backend risk adjustment engine on October 18th, 2021 using the risk adjustment model CMS-HCC V24. As shown in this example report, Eve Everywoman has five Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCCs). Three of the HCCs are historic diagnoses and two are suspected diagnoses. For example, one of the historic diagnoses is HCC 18 (Diabetes with no Complications). The status of this coding gap is shown as closed and the evidence status date is April 1, 2021. The supporting evidence field shows the clinical data that was used to close the coding gap HCC 18.

### Resources and Profiles

The following resources and their profiles specified in this guide are used to support sharing risk adjustment coding gap reports from Server to Client:

|Resource Type|Profile Name|Link to Profile|
|---|---|---|
|Bundle|Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle Profile|[Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle]|
|Group|Patient Group Profile|[Patient Group]|
|MeasureReport|Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Profile|[Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report]|
|Measure|Risk Adjustment Model Measure Profile|[Risk Adjustment Model Measure]|

Figure 3-3 provides a graphical view of how these resources are related to the example report above. The main resource is the [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] profile. This coding gap report references a [Risk Adjustment Model Measure], which indicates CMS-HCC V24 is the risk adjustment model this report is based on. The coding gap report also references the Patient ([USCore Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html)) as well as the Organization ([USCore Organization](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-organization.html)) that generated the report. The graph shows three groups within a [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] using three example HCCs from Figure 3-2 to illustrate each `group` corresponds to an HCC including its attributes.
