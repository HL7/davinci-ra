### Introduction

The Da Vinci Project member organizations have identified the need of standardizing how risk adjustment coding gaps are communicated between payers and providers. This release of the Implementation Guide (guide) specifies standardized risk adjustment coding gap reports and defines an operation for a Client to query the coding gap reports from a Server for one or more patients. Standardizing the reporting structure helps lessen the burden on the providers in processing the reports so they can more easily address the patients’ care needs. This standardized structure also supports the payer sharing information that they have but the providers may not, such as data from other providers’s claims, lab results, filled prescriptions, etc.

### Preconditions and Assumptions
(TODO: review and edit)
- A contract for medical services exists between the server and the client requesting the report.
- A risk adjustment model(s) has been defined.
- The Server organization has determined the risk adjustment condition categories and suspect statuses based on the data they have and risk adjustment engine they use. As indicated in Scope, this guide does not define how a Server determines risk adjustment coding gaps shared on this report.
- It is the responsibility of the Server to ensure that the data used in the report is present in a structured, retrievable form.
- The server and the client have agreed upon a process to identify specific patient(s) and exchange the Patient Resource's logical id on the server.
-  Although the exact mechanisms for securing these exchanges are not specified as part of this guide:
    -  Exchanges are limited to mutually agreed upon (i.e., between the Server and Client) patient lists or population.
    -  Systems should use standard authentication and authorization approaches.  The [SMART App Launch] and [SMART backend services] authentication/authorization approach are recommended models.

### Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Reports

The risk adjustment coding gap reports are generated by a Server’s back end systems such as legacy system, FHIR server, and risk adjustment engine. The [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report], a profile of the [MeasureReport] resource, provides a standardized representation to construct these reports. The [$report] operation defined in this guide can be used by a Client to request risk adjustment coding gap reports of applicable risk adjustment models for one or more patients (a group) from the Server. The [$report] operation requires three input parameters: `periodStart`, `periodEnd`, and `subject`.

The term clinical evaluation period refers to the time period during which the risk adjusting encounters could be conducted and documented with expectations of submissions for risk adjustment purposes. Period start and end parameters are the start and end dates of the clinical evaluation period. The `periodStart` and `periodEnd` dates will be evaluated for any overlaps against the clinical evaluation period (`MeasureReport.period.start` and `MeasureReport.period.end`) of a [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] available on the Server. The `subject` parameter references either a single patient or a group of patients (as specified in the [Patient Group] profile).

The [$report] operation returns a [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle] based on the input (IN) parameters if matching risk adjustment coding gap reports were found on the Server for a patient. This bundle is a FHIR collection bundle, which must contain a patient entry and zero or more entries of risk adjustment coding gap reports. The [$report] operation also defines another output (OUT) parameter, `OperationOutcome`, to address scenarios when the `subject` provided is invalid. Detailed documentation and conformance statements are listed on the page for [$report].

Each [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] is for a single patient (the required `MeasureReport.subject` references [USCore Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html) and a version specific risk adjustment model. If the Server's risk adjustment engine runs multiple risk adjustment models including different versions of the same model, then there will be multiple risk adjustment coding gap reports for a patient. For example, if a risk adjustment engine runs reports using CMS-HCC v25, CMS-HCC v24, and Rx-HCC v5, there will be three separate risk adjustment coding gap reports for a patient and for each of the three version specific models. The risk adjustment model information is specified in the [Risk Adjustment Model Measure] profile. The `measure` element of the [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] references the [Risk Adjustment Model Measure].

The [MeasureReport] resource has zero to many `group` elements. Each `group` element contains information for a Condition Category, therefore, multiple Condition Category code. The `group.code` is used to represent the actual code for a Condition Category, such as HCC 19 (Diabetes without Complication). The [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] profile added several extensions to the MeasureReport resource’s `group` element to provide additional information about a Condition Category, which includes:
 - the suspect type for a Condition Category coding gap that is either historic, suspected, or unsuspected;
 - the evidence status of a Condition Category coding gap that is either confirmed, non-confirmed, or pending;
 - the evidence status date indicating when the evidence status was last updated; and
 - the hiearchical status indicating whether hierarchies were applied to a Condition Category, and if applied, whether the Condition Category is superseded. The status can be either applied-supperceded, applied-not-supperceded, not-applied, or not-applicable.

In addition, the [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report] provides capability of sharing supporting evidence for a Condition Category through the use of the `MeasureReport.evaluatedResource` element. This supporting evidence may include resources for data such as encounters, lab results, medications, and procedures, and the `evaluatedResource` shall reference the appropriate US Core profile. The extension [ra-groupReference](StructureDefinition-ra-groupReference.html) added to the `evaluatedResource` element enables tying a specific supporting evidence to a particular Condition Category. This is accomplished by setting the extension’s `valueString` to be the same value of the `MeasureGroup.group.id` of the Condition Category to establish the association between a supporting evidence and one or more Condition Categories.  

### Risk Adjustment Coding Gaps Reporting

Figure 3-1 is an example risk adjustment coding gap report. The Client calls the [$report] operation for patient Eve Everywoman (subject) and for a clinical evaluation period from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 (periodStart and periodEnd). The Server receives the request and finds a matching risk adjustment coding gap report for Eve Everywoman that has a clinical evaluation period of January 1, 2021 to September 30, 2021, which overlaps the periodStart and periodEnd dates provided in the [$report] operation. This report was created by the backend risk adjustment engine on October 18th, 2021 using the risk adjustment model CMS-HCC V24.
As shown in this example report, Eve Everywoman has five Hierarchical Condition Categories (HCC) and of which three conditions are historic diagnoses and two are suspected diagnoses. For example, one of the historic diagnoses is HCC 18, Diabetes with no Complications. This coding gap shows as closed and the evidence status was last updated on April 1, 2021. The supporting evidence shows the clinical data that was used to close the coding gap HCC 18.

### Resources and Profiles

The following resources and their profiles specified in this guide are used to support sharing adjustment coding gap reports from Server to Client:

|Resource Type|Profile Name|Link to Profile|
|---|---|---|
|Bundle|Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle Profile|[Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Bundle]|
|Group|Patient Group Profile|[Patient Group]|
|MeasureReport|Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Profile|[Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report]|
|Measure|Risk Adjustment Model Measure Profile|[Risk Adjustment Model Measure]|

Figure 3-2 provides a graphical view of how these resources are related to the report above.  The main resource is the [Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Profile].  This profile first references a [Risk Adjustment Model Measure Profile] which is how we indicate which risk model the report is based on.  The Patient [USCore Patient](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.html) as well as the Organization(US Core Organization) that generated the Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report are referenced.  

Each Hierarchical Condition Code is represented by a Group within the report.  You will notice that each Group has supporting evidence of the Encounter.  Additionally, you will see resources on the right of the report that support the specific HCC code.  

For the first group, HCC 189, it points to an historic diagnosis of Acquired absence of right leg below knee which was received as part of the April 1st, 2021 claim. This makes that HCC code confirmed.  

The second group, HCC 019, historic diagnosis points to a Condition of Morbid Obesity from a prior year.  Since this was not included on the April claim, it is non-confirmed.

The last group contains a suspected HCC code of 022.  The supporting evidence that points to this Group are two observations (lab results), from December of 2020; a urine glucose of 3+ and an Hemaglobin A1C.  Since this is only a suspected gap, it is also non-confirmed.

### Requesting Risk Adjustment Coding Gap reports

To facilitate a client requesting Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Reports, an operation ([$report]) has been defined in this Implementation Guide.  The input parameters are a from/to date to align with the clinical evaluation period and a subject.  The subject can reference a Patient.id (Patient/id123) or a reference to a Risk Adjustment [Patient Group Profile] (Group/gr345) as defined in this IG.  All three parameters are required.  The patient resource returned with the report must conform to the US Core Patient Profile.  Note that the reference is to the Patient logical id (Patient.id) on the server.  As noted above, it is a pre-assumption that getting the logical id for the patient has been done using a method agreed upon between the organization acting as the server and organization acting as the client.

The operation will return a bundle of the bundle.type "collection" which will include 1 or more Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Reports and all referenced resources.  For example, if a single patient has 2 Risk Adjustment Models that pertain to them, the bundle will contain two MeasureReport resources ([Risk Adjustment Coding Gap Report Profile]) and any other resources referenced by the two MeasureReport Resources, such as Patient, Organization (that generated the report), Conditions, Observations, Medications, Measure, etc.
