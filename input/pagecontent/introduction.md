### Risk Adjustment Model

#### CMS-HCC Risk Adjustment Model
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Hierarchical Condition Categories (CMS-HCC) model includes diagnoses recorded on professional, inpatient, and outpatient claims. The CMS-HCC model adjusts Medicare capitation payments to Medicare Advantage Organizations (MAOs) for the variation in health expenditure risk of enrollees in their plans. This model more accurately captured the risk of enrolling beneficiaries with varying health status, thus addressing the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) mandate that MAOs be paid based on the variation in expected health care costs of the population they enroll, and reducing the incentive for biased selection in Medicare’s risk based payment program.

Risk adjustment is a method of adjusting capitation payments to health plans, to account for the differences in expected health costs of individuals enrolled in the plan. For health plans not offered through the Medicare program, insurers determine their revenue needs based on a variety of factors, including trends in medical expenditures, benefits offered, and anticipated enrollment, and then determine how to set the premium, deductible, co-payment amounts, etc. charged to individuals or groups of enrollees within the rules of markets in which they operate. The risk adjustment models used in the Medicare Advantage program function as a more comprehensive method of underwriting in
which diagnoses and demographic information are used to adjust each enrollee’s monthly
capitation rate to account for the expected cost associated with their age, sex, and the conditions
they have. As with any insurance design, risk adjustment is intended to be accurate at the group
level. At the individual level, predicted medical costs can be lower or higher than actual medical
costs, but at the group level, below-average predicted costs balance out above-average predicted
costs. In the following section, we first present relevant background on the function of risk
adjustment and then describe the main components of the CMS-HCC models.
