Although the exact mechanisms for securing these exchanges are not specified as part of this IG:
- Exchanges are limited to mutually agreed upon (i.e., between the Server and the Client) patient lists or population.
- Systems should use standard authentication and authorization approaches. The [SMART App Launch] and [SMART backend services] authentication/authorization approach are recommended models.
